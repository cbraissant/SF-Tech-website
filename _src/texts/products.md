# Features

**We only do one size: yours** All of our suits are custom-made allowing the diver to choose from a variety of products and options. Our made-to-measure standards guarantee a suit close to body without any unnecessary extra material.

**Self-sufficiency** We choose to equip our suits with a front zipper, to allow the diver to be independant in his gearing process. To ensure durability and reliability, only the best zipper on the market are used: a custom made YKK metal zipper. A telescopic torso eases the doning and doffing process by proving extra length to the torso while puting the head through the neck seal. It also enhances the mobility by allowing extra material to be deployed when bending and kneeling. On request, the suit can be fitted with a back entry zipper instead of front entry.Options
