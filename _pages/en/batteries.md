Modern power supply for heating systems. Simplicity, intuitive operation and reliable performances.

Easy to use - A three-position magnetic switch allows you to adjust the battery intensity underwater. The shape and position of the switch make it accessible even when wearing thick gloves. A second outlet on the top of the battery allows you to connect a waterproof lamp. The battery is charged through the additional connector on the top of the head. The case remains permanently closed guaranteeing long-term waterproofing.

Smart Electronics - A LED  on the top of the head indicates battery status and charge level. The electronics in the head automatically recognize when the E/O cable is disconnected and cut off the output voltage, protecting the connector from electrolysis. Power is automatically restored when the heating system is reconnected.

Performance - The battery is available in two versions: The standard version with a maximum operating depth of 100m, and the SPECIAL version certified up to 200m. In both versions, the housing and the head are made of anodized aluminum and Delrin®. Quality, durability and irreproachable finishes!
