The SF Tech TNT, is made of a revolutionary <strong>Patent-Pending</strong> material: a high density neoprene based trilaminate, with two extra layers of Titanium acting as heat-reflective panel. The overall material feels up to 2x warmer than a standard butyl trilaminate.
The TNT offers all the advantages of trilaminate while being warmer and more flexible like a neoprene: <strong>The best of both worlds</strong>

To guarantee strength and reliability, the overall suit is made of Kevlar® reinforced fabric. Only the best materials available on the market are used. The high-density neoprene is made by Yamamoto while the Kevlar® is made in Switzerland. 

The SF Tech TNT is the perfect drysuit for demanding divers looking for a tailor made, top of the line dryuit with unprecedent freedom of movement, and unequalled robustness.

As standard, the SF Tech TNT comes equiped with 2 cargo pockets on the legs, front entry zipper and telescopic torso allowing the diver the to be self-sufficient in the donning and doffing process. The fold of the suit is held in place by a crotch strap.
