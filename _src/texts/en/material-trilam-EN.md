## Trilam

The term trilaminate means a multi-layered material composed of three layers of overlapping materials, laminated together. An inner and outer linings provide the strength and durability whereas the middle layer ensure the watertightness of the material.
The impermeable material is made of butyl rubber and is just a few tenth of millimeter thick. To avoid tearing and ripping, an outer protective fabric is necessary. Usually, a strong, non-elastic woven material (nylon, polyester, Kevlar,...)

Due to its minimal thickness, trilam does not provide any thermal insulation. Therefore, the diver must use appropriate undergarment, generally thicker than with a neoprene drysuit. However, the buoyancy of the material is reduced and the material is drying faster.

Despite the many technological advances and material improvements, the name Trilam stayed and now encompass various materials made from 2 (bi-laminate) up to 8 (octo-laminate) layers.
Technically speaking, as describe above, neoprene is a trilaminate material where the middle liner is made of neoprene. But to avoid confusion, both technical terms, Neoprene and Trialm, are used to describe the categories of products.

### Trilaminate with KevlarÂ® protection

| Layer            | Material                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| Outer layer      | Kevlar, Nylon, Polyester |
| Waterproof layer | Butyl                    |
| Inner layer      | Polyester                |

### Trilaminate with Nylon Ripstop protection

| Layer            | Material  |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Outer layer      | Nylon     |
| Waterproof layer | Butyl     |
| Inner layer      | Polyester |
