The SF Tech Trilam Classic Kevlar® is a versatile suit for recreational and technical divers, in both cold and tempered water. With its Kevlar® reinforcements, the Trilam Classic is suited for open water divers as well as cave or wreck divers.

The trilaminate material is lightweight and flexible and the shape of the fitted cut of the drysuit provide excellent freedom of movement. The Front-zipper entry as well as the telescopic torso allow the diver to be self-sufficient in the donning and doffing process.

Kevlar® reinforcement are provided on arms, chest, back as well as the knees and crotch area. The rest of the suit is made of Nylon RipStop, a material commonly used for the manufacture of technical products with high stresses, such as paraglider or boat sails.
