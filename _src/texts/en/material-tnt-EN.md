## TNT: Trilaminate Neoprene Titanium

Revolutionary material invented and developped in the premises of SF Tech, TNT is a trilaminate material using high density neoprene foam as an impermeable layer instead of butyl rubber.

The initial fabrication process of the TNT is the same as a neoprene material. A layer of neoprene foam is laminated with an inner and outer layer. Then, the overall material undergoes a second compression phase in a hyperbaric chamber. This process creates a thin, flexible, ultra dense neoprene trilaminate. By using neoprene as a impermeable medium instead of butyl, flexibility and heat retaining property are drastically improved, with an increase of heat insulation up to 40%.

To further improve the thermal isolation of the material, a coating of solid Titanium alloy, called Ti-Alpha, is applied directly on either side of the neoprene sheet, creating an efficient insulating barrier. The exterior layer reduces cold absortion and the interior layer increases heat reflection, keeping the warm body temperature inside the suit. By reducing heat exchange and acting as a reflective barrier, the titanium significantly improve thermal insulation up to 40%.

By combining the heat properties of the neoprene and the reflective layers of Titanium, TNT drysuit feels nearly twice as warm as a corresponding butyl trilaminate drysuit.

As with our butyl trilaminate, state of the art textiles are used on our TNT. The Kevlar<sup>&reg;</sup> outer layer is exactly the same and consist of Kevlar<sup>&reg;</sup> reinforced Nylon and Polyester, whereas the inner layer is made of Nylon.
