## Batteries

High technology battery made with high quality materials. Realized carbon fiber battery body to reduce the volume and apparent weight of the battery.

Two different battery sizes are available: the Standard having a capacity of 23.8 Ah and the Mini of 13.6 Ah. Each battery consists of three cells in series providing an output voltage of 11.1V (maximum 12.6V at full load). The maximum output powers are respectively 175W and 100W.

Manufactured in Delrin, the removable head is available is standard straight version or sidemount version. The sidemount version offers a 90 ° output to optimize the wiring of the E/O cable when the battery is mounted on the crotch strap. The E/O cables are reinforced using a metal cable gland. Two o-rings located on the head of the battery guarantee the watertightness. Locking of the head to the body is done with a spring pin. Each battery has a LEDs charge indicator.
