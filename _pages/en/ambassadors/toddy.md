catchphrase: "It's an absolutely robust suit that fits my expectations exactly.
I work mainly in caves and I need the best suit on the market. The SF Tech suits are for me the best choice for my work and explorations."

Thorsten "Toddy" Wälde is an instructor and trainer in technical diving. He is the inventor and "brain" behind the Toddy-Style sidemount system. At the age of 22, he decided to start a professional diving career. After several years as a dive instructor and operator of dive centres in Offenburg and Freiburg (Breisgau), he turned to technical Trimix diving and in 2001 to Mexico. There he lived and worked for several years on the Yucatan Peninsula, focusing on cave diving, working as a guide and dive instructor, and participating in expeditions, films and research projects in the vast and complex cave systems of the Mexican peninsula.

In 2004 he returned to Europe with the aim of establishing a diving and training centre specifically for cave diving education. In search of a suitable location for this project, he found Sardinia, where there is a large number of underwater and subaquatic cave systems to explore. In 2005 he decided to create "Protec Sardinia" in Cala Gonone on the Golfo di Orosei. From guided dives to CCR caving instructor training, everything is possible at "Protect Sardinia".
