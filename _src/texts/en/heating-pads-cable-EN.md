## Pads wiring

Wiring between the heating valve and the four heating pads of the heating system. The connection between the cable and the pads is made using small waterproof connectors. The cable can be unplugged and the pads disconnected to remove them and dive without the heating, or wash the undergarments.

The connection with the heating valve is made using a waterproof push lock connector, to facilitate connection while gearing up and ensuring a stable connection during the dive.

 For maximum flexibility and strength, the insulation of the electrical wires is made of silicone and the cables are covered with a nylon braided protective sheath.
