The SF Tech Neoprene Kevlar PRO is the strongest neoprene drysuit you can find. Made entirely of 2mm hyper-compressed neoprene with Kevlar<sup>&reg;</sup> reinforced fabric, this suit is design to last. Developped for demanding divers in rough environments, the SF Tech Kevlar PRO is the perfect tool for technical or commercial divers, but is also suited for recreational divers wanting the best!

The core of the material is made of 2mm hyper-compress Yamamoto neoprene, a dense closed-cell foam keeping it's density even at great depth. Kevlar<sup>&reg;</sup> reinforced fabric covers the whole suit and an extra protective layer is added on the knees pads.

As standard, the SF Tech Kevlar PRO comes with a front entry zipper and telescopic torso allowing the diver the to be self-sufficient in the donning and doffing process. The fold of the suit is held in place by a crotch strap.
