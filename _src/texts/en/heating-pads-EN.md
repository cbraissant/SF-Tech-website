## Heating Pads

The heating elements are pads made of breathable fabric, having a dimension of 33x16cm. Each pad has a maximum power of 10W, providing a total power of 40W for the four heating elements. Each element is independent, allowing the user to replace himself a pad, to remove the pads to clean the undergarment or to dive without heating.

The pads are attached to the pockets of the undersuit by a velcro, to prevent them from moving during use. A waterproof connector connects the pads to the electrical wiring passing through the lining of the garment.
