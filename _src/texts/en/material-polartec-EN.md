## Polartec®

Polartec® Power Stretch® has the ability to retain warmth without restricting movement or agility during activities. The outer surface has a low-friction finish that reduces irritation when worn with other fabrics and increases overall abrasion resistance. The next-to-skin layer stays dry, breathable and comfortable by continuously transferring moisture vapor for rapid evaporation. Reinforced elastic fibers ensure the fabric consistently rebounds after every stretch.

This versatility provides flexible support and warmth for reliable comfort in any sport based activity. Polartec® wicks moisture like a base material, but can handle direct exposure to the elements when necessary.

**Odor resistant**: Garments stay fresher for longer between washes. A silver salt (salt chloride) inhibits the growth of odor causing bacteria for the life of the garment

**Durable water repellent**: Greatly increases the fabric's inherent ability the resist water and snow without sacrificing breathability

**Hardface**:  Dramatically increases abrasion resistance, reduces surface friction against other layers  and adds durable water repellency

**Recycled with repreve®**: Fabric contains a minimum of 50% Repreve® recycled fibers that conserve energy and reduce CO2 emissions

**Easy care**: Polartec® fabrics are known for their easy care and lasting durability. Most Polartec® fabric can be washed in warm water and tumbled dry on low and in most cases this will deliver the best post-wash feel and performance
