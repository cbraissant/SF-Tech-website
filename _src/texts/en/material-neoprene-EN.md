## Neoprene

A synthetic rubber made by polymerization of chloroprene. Neoprene exhibits good chemical stability and maintains flexibility over a wide range of temperature. Neoprene foam is produced in either closed-cell or open-cell form. The closed-cell version is waterproof and used for wetsuits and drysuits. The foam is formed by injecting the neoprene with nitrogen gas, creating gas cells inside the material thus increasing its insulation properties.

Neoprene is produce in large block of material and cut to the required thickness, varying from 1mm to 10mm. The greater the thickness, the better the thermal insulation. To provide strength and protection, the foam can be laminated on either side with nylon, polyester or various other fabrics.

Due to its inherent structure, neoprene foam has a positive buoyancy. Since the foam largely contains gas pockets, the thickness and the buoyancy of the neoprene decrease at depth, loosing some of its thermal insulation.

The quality of the neoprene depends on the foam used and the density of the material. The amout of gas cells and their size is directly related to the durability of the foam. A denser neoprene will be more durable, less buoyant and resist better to the great ambiant pressure at depth.

**YAMAMOTO: Limestone Based Neoprene** In an effort to provide the perfect material to its customer, SF Tech is using the best neoprene available on the market. A Japanese neoprene foam made at 99.7% of Limestone,  (calcium carbonate) making it more environment-friendly than petroleum-based products. We use only #88 neoprene,  a high-density hyper-compressed neoprene foam with excellent thermal insulation, exceptional durability and can withstand high pressure without loosing its properties.
