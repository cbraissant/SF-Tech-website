## Heating

The SF Tech heating system is based on a modular principle that makes it easy to remove or replace heating elements. This system uses heated pads made of breathable fabric that are connected to each other through an electrical wiring. The modular system makes it possible to replace pads or wire, quickly and without having to change the undergarment.

SF Tech heated gloves can be used independently or in conjunction with the heating pads system via a Y-connector. The SF Tech sweater is specially designed to accommodate the heating system thanks to the pockets provided for the pads, as well as openings for the cables of the gloves. The total power of the system is 76W, the pads providing a maximum of 40W (10W per pad) and the gloves 36W.

For safety reasons, no battery is used inside the dry suit. The external battery is connected to the heating elements via a heating valve. This Delrin-machined element with standard inflator and E/O connector replace the standard inflator. The heating valve acts as an electrical connection and an inflator. Alternatively, an insert can be used to use the original inflator.

Four types of batteries are available depending on the capacity and orientation of the E/O cable. The standard battery (23.8 Ah) and the mini (13.6 Ah), both are also available in sidemount version (output at 90 Â°). All batteries have a carbon fiber body, to lighten the battery, and the head is made of Delrin, a strong and durable material. On the battery pack, five light emitting diodes (LEDs) indicate the current charge of the battery.
