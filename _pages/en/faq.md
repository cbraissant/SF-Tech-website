### Orders and mesurements
What are the diff√©rences between a TNT and a Neo?
: The main difference is the type of fabric used. The neoprene thickness is different between the two technologies. The **TNT** has an insulating layer of 0.5mm and the **Neo** of 2mm. The **TNT** drysuits will be more flexible and versatile, and the **Neo** warmer. [Find out more about our materials](https://www.sftech.ch/{{page.lang}}/materials)

What are the standard accessories?
: As standard, the suits are equipped with a latex neck seal, latex wrist seals, metal zipper, attached 5mm boots, 5mm K01 hood and are delivered without pockets. The TNT models also have a protective zipper.

What are the delivery times?
: Our delivery times vary depending on the season and workload. <br>
Overall, it takes from six to twelve weeks from order to delivery.<br>
Please [contact us](https://www.sftech.ch/{{page.lang}}/contact) directly for more information and precise deadlines.

How are the measurements taken?
: Several options are possible for taking the measurement:<br>
   - Directly at our premises in Switzerland.<br>
   - From an official retailer.<br>
   - By completing the measurement form, and sending it to us by email. We have the possibility to control certain measurements, however we cannot offer a guarantee in this case. In case of doubt, it is also possible to organize a video conference in order to take the measures together.

Where are the drysuits made?
: All our drysuits are manufactured in our premises in Puidoux, Switzerland.

### Options and accessories
What are the differences between a **latex**, **neoprene** and **silicone** neck seal?
: - The **Latex** is a flexible and thin material, but relatively fragile. It is necessary to use talc to preserve it. In case of tearing, it is necessary to have it changed by a professional.
- The **neoprene** neck seal is custom-made from 2mm smooth skin neoprene. To have the smooth part against the skin and be waterproof, the top of the neck seal must be turned over on itself. Compared to latex or silicone, neoprene is warmer avoiding cold spots at the base of the neck. Small wears and tears can be repaired by yourself, but larger damage requires professional replacement.
- The **silicone** neck seal is a self-changing modular system. The neck seal is clipped into a flexible ring glued to the drysuit. Silicone, like latex, is a thin and flexible material, with no inherent thermal insulation. [Find more about Si Tech Quick Neck](https://www.sitech.se/products/modular-solutions/quick-neck.aspx)

What are the differences between **Rolock** and **Rolock90**?
: The **Rolock** system is made to be mounted on latex wrist seals, and has a diameter of 85mm.<br>
The **Rolock90** system is made to be mounted on a Si Tech QCS interchangeable wrist seal, and has a diameter of 90mm.

### Service and repairs
What are the steps to send my drysuit to be repaired?
: In the event of a shipment to our premises in Switzerland, the suit must be sent alone, without accessories or bag, and with empty pockets.<br>

My zipper is hard to open and close, what should I do?
: Metal zippers are particularly hard to operate when new.<br>
Before each usage, paraffin must be applied to the zipper's outer teeth to make handling easier and extend the zipper's lifespan. More information can be found in the [user manual](https://www.sftech.ch/{{page.lang}}/downloads/)

My neoprene neck seal is damaged, how do I repair it?
: A hole or a slight tear on a neoprene neck seal is relatively common. In most cases, a user repair can be carried out without the need to immobilize the suit.<br>
The neoprene must be glued edge-to-edge in order to keep is flexibility and elasticity. **Do not use Aquasure nor patch**
- Pinch the fabric at the notch
- Apply contact glue on the two sides of the neoprene and allow to dry
- Glue the two parts together edge to edge
