The SF Tech vest is specially designed to offer the best possible experience in a dry suit. Polartec<sup>&reg;</sup> Power Stretch<sup>&reg;</sup> has the ability to retain warmth without restricting movement or agility during activities. Polartec<sup>&reg;</sup> is a breathable material that continuously evacuates water vapor while retaining heat. The layer in contact with the skin remains dry and comfortable.

The sleeveless SF Tech vest covers the upper part of the body and is used in conjunction with other undergarments. To ensure effective heating, the vest should be worn close to the body, between the skin and the undersuit. A wide elastic crotch strap holds the clothes in place when dressing or diving.

The vest is designed for the SF Tech heating system. Four internal pockets are made to receive heating pads. Two heating elements on the torso and two elements on the back. The wiring of the cables is through the lining of the sweater and openings are provided at each pad location. Thus, all cables are passed inside the garment.
