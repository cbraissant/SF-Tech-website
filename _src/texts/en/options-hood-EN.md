## Hood

### Separated

All of our suits come as standard with a 7mm neoprene hood. Fitted with smooth skin neoprene around the neck and the face, it prevents water around the head keeping the diver warm.
Exhaust holes on the top a the hood are designed to let air escape, avoiding unnecessary air formation, while keeping the water entry to a bare minimum.

Instead of a separated hood, a made-to-mesure hood can be attached to the drysuit. Made of 7mm neoprene with smooth skin around the face to prevent water entry.

### Full face mask

Special purpose hood for full face mask or other custom type can be made on request.
