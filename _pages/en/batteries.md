The SF Tech sweater is specially designed to offer the best possible experience in a dry suit. Polartec® Power Stretch® has the ability to retain warmth without restricting movement or agility during activities. Polartec® is a breathable material that continuously evacuates water vapor while retaining heat. The layer in contact with the skin remains dry and comfortable.

The shape is studied to facilitate the dressing and to keep the clothes in place during the dive. The longer dorsal part covers the lower back even when moving forward, and the thumb holes hold the sleeves in place when donnign the drysuit.

The sweater is made for the SF Tech heating system. Four internal pockets are made to receive heating pads. Two heating elements on the torso and two elements in the back. The wiring of the cables is through the lining of the sweater and openings are provided at each pad location and forearms for the heated glove system. Thus, all cables are passed inside the garment.
